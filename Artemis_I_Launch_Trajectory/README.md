# Artemis I Launch Simulation
Post launch reconstruction of the Artemis I launch trajectory. 

Please refer to the publication [Artemis I Launch Trajectory Reconstruction with the MyRocketSimulator Python Package](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379640560_Artemis_I_Launch_Trajectory_Reconstruction_with_the_MyRocketSimulator_Python_Package) to gain insights about how this simulation was set up and it outcome.

## Mission output
Exemplary visualization of the flight in GCRF. Segment 0 is on ground (not visible), segment 1 launch to end of TLI, segment 2 coasting to ICPS separation, stage 3 up to USS, stage 4 up to RSV.
